# Research Archive — Coding AI Guide

This folder preserves exploratory notes and historical records. Use it only for context when decisions need deeper background.

## Contents

- `TECHNOLOGY_RESEARCH_ARCHIVE.md` — Comparative studies of models, vector databases, and infrastructure.
- `REVIEW_REPORT_ARCHIVE.md` — Feedback from earlier design reviews and how we addressed them.
- `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` — Performance tuning history.
- `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` — Notes from restructuring the documentation set.

For current direction, rely on:

- `decisions/AI_DECISION_RECORD.md` for up‑to‑date decisions.
- Phase Final docs in `blueprints/phase_final/docs/` and `architecture/`.

Treat this archive as supplemental reading when reconsidering model or infrastructure choices.
