# Review Report Archive — Coding AI Summary

Previous design reviews concluded that the Phase Final documentation set is comprehensive and aligned around:
- Focused user persona (self-media creators).
- Progressive architecture (start simple, scale with demand).
- SigLIP + BLIP perception stack with pgvector-backed search.

Minor issues addressed:
- Directory listings corrected to match actual files.
- Handover doc linked from Phase Final README.

Future implementers should still validate assumptions (model size downloads, performance tuning) during execution and log findings in the research folder.
